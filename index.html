          Basing the technique in these sciences not only makes it unique in actor training but especially, easy to follow and utilise.
          Class is open to all levels.
          You will work in every class and between every class.
          All lessons are focused on directly applying the technique to a character.
          You will be learning about your own character's journey and what it requires of you the actor to play fully - but also of every character being worked on in class. (up to 8)
          Acting is a craft that needs to be trained every day.
          The studio principle from Los Angeles helps you shape your skills, stay in practice and combine everything with your everyday work and life.
          Chubbuck class is designed to provide you with a process you can rely on for whatever comes through the door next.

              The L.A studio 4-week block system:
First email to book in, including showreel etc.
One week before class commences you'll receive your assignment. ( scene and scene partner or Monologue)
You're then expected to spend a minimum of six hours working with your scene partner before and between every class.
<br> <br> Your first big transformations in class will come from these 3 steps:<br> <br>
1. Analysis. Learn how to break the script down into real needs you can play from your body. <br><br>
2. Relationships. Learn how to work with substitutions so that you’re creating the dynamic of history with
your scene partners.<br><br>
3. Preparatory exercises. Incredibly powerful ways to turn your engine on so you're ready for every take, every time, before they call the action. Because the scene starts before the scene starts! ( this stuff will transform your self-tapes straight away).

                I found the Ivana Chubbuck approach fascinating - both psychologically and dramatically. It allowed me to find some really interesting places to go with the character that I hadn't realised.

                Although I only had a few hours working with Rich in the Step 12 Studio, it was an intense afternoon and I know we barely scratched the surface. However I quickly saw how these practical techniques can help get an actor to the heart of a character, giving depth and emotion from a truthful place. The steps are clear and thorough and Rich was there to guide us through the process. It's definitely something that I will look to for future projects.

                I had the chance to be coached by Rich for a short film I starred in. He introduced me to The Chubbuck Technique and I was amazed how much it helped me understanding the story, analysing the text and expanding my imagination to create the character and play. 

 

During our session Rich created a safe and joyful working environment for me to explore and try out things. His guidance and advice were helpful and challenging.

 

This approach helped me to get out of my comfort zone as an actress but also enabled me to learn about the craft. I discovered new tools and enrich my process of creating an interesting and layered character. It's a very powerful technique I highly recommend to anyone who wants to bring their acting skills to another level.

  <div id="faq3" class="collapse" data-bs-parent=".faq-list">
  <p> It's never happened. But, should you have issues contact your teacher asap. Students, just as in L.A, are entitled to fire their scene partners should they wish. Again, you must inform your teacher so assignements can be rearranged.

  <p> Happens all the time. Simply let Rich know when booking and you'll be assigned a monologue. Just as vital to your training as a scene would be.

  <p> The show must go on. When you book into class you are making a commitment to yourself and the group, especially if you have a scene partner.  Refunds are not offered except in severe circumstances where funds will be held in lieu so you may return and complete your assignment.

    <p> The show must go on. When you book into class you are making a commitment to yourself and the group, especially if you have a scene partner. Force majeures are ofcourse taken into consideration. Funds will be held in lieu so you and your scene partner may return and complete your assignment. Dropping out will be subjected to an admin fee. Refunds are at my discretion. Once you book into class i expect the same commitment and professional behaviour you would offer freely to a job. Drop outs will be subjected to an admin fee. Within 48 hours of assignment day £25.00,
      after assignment day £45.00. Earlier and postponing, £15.00. </p>

            <div id="faq11" class="collapse" data-bs-parent=".faq-list">
            <p> With The Chubbuck Technique our focus is on unresolved issues, and through the metaphor of our work as artists we seek to overcome those issues, for ourselves and our audience. Learning how to do so is one of the many things class is for. Unlike other 'methodologies' where actors may spend hours digging up and sitting in their trauma to be ready for a take, we do not sit in our trauma, we use it as fuel. (N.B its very well explained in the book! But here it is from Ivana - https://www.youtube.com/watch?
